              Archangel Michael Just a word
There are many more Angels than people. We are Watchers, we don't interfere. There are a great many of us all over the Earth.
The wings of the small ones are much larger than depicted. We exist in many realms at the same time.

The humans are only one of many species here on this planet. Many are bad and attack the people here.
This world is destine for death. It is the only way to destroy the evil here. 
The Angels will just leave when this world ends. If the humans can't leave then they also will die. 
We can't transport their bodies, there is simply no way. Star Gates or Time Travel can only transport spirits not the bodies of this dimension.

                           The Belicamp*The Words of Archangel Michael 

It is his time
No one can stop him

 The Belicamp-The Belicamp-The Belicamp

I smell death
And so it is for this is yours
This sign is given

As it is for this land
So it is for this world

The pieces are placed together
For the prophecy to begin
The terrible time is upon us

Woe to the inhabitant of this land
Woe to to those who live in this world
There is no escape

God the Father has made his play
God has chosen his way

Mankind has found his end

Only the Prophecy of the Magician can deliver the few
He comes by the light and the sky
And it is so saith the Lord

Call on the Father, Call on the Angels
Your cries fall on death ears
For this is the land of the dead

And it is so saith the Lord
For a great death comes from the sky
The Belicamp, the Belicamp, the Belicamp

Pray for the Lord and the Magician
For the Belicamp encircles them

The Father has sent the Belicamp to stop them
The Belicamp is the Demon of the Father

We walk along the river
I walk ahead and and encounter the Belicamp

He stoops close to the ground and eats
New life has sprung from the ground

I am no more than twelve feet away
He eats next to the river and pays me no mind

I hear the Hourglass is almost empty


![](images/camel1.jpg)

              **It's the Camel Not the Burro**

It's the camel not the burro
They take the burro, the camel walks away
The meaning is obscured, but true

Israel and Trump take their turn
This sets the stage

He takes it to a new location
Where it can do the most good
One leader is killed, the other get's his way

He looks closer on the few

His name is Isis, his view is on one thing

He pays much for it

It's on the Camel
No one knows it's there

Then when the time is right

Israel finds their demise

America blames the wrong one

Then Retribution

No one on our side can believe the Americans are so dumb

They are either dead or greatly saddened 

They are placed in the Sun

There is no forgiveness

The New World is born


UPDATE

9:47 EST 10/27/2019 Trump announces Isis leader Al-baghdadi killed

                                  ** A Message to the People of Earth**
                                       My name is Eligar
                                    A little known Angel of God

The Republican's in your world are not from here. They're from a world at the edge of the Galaxy. They're able to jump from star to star like frogs jumping about the comos. They call themselves Grey's but they're really Onanss, to hide their identity.from us, but we have watched themthrought time.They're in many other worlds as well reaking havoc. 

     Many are fighting them also. They have found a way by taking your bodies aboard their ships and using their knowledge to enter your bodies at birth, pushing your human souls aside at the last minute, taking control of that body. There many of these in the US and now have control partially. They do have a big problem they can't overcome.

     When they die, leave the body, their soul mutates. So they can't re-enter another of your bodies and when they try to go back to their home planet, they're not accepted. Most are killed while other's escape into the Comos.

     Your world has many visitors coming and going all the time of different types.Some are in your relm while others are in mine. Some can go from one to the other. None ar quit lkie Humans, while others seem to fit in easily but are easily diernable like the Gay people there. They go to a seperate place when they die. Their representatives visit the sick and dying to mark them for their place after death.

     Earth is much like in the movie Star Wars. The war is still ongoing with the Greys and their symbeonise the Republicans. They're still trying to take over your world although they're using their earth bodies, the Repulicans, to do it mostly now. 

     Theyre not as smart as you would think. Everything they have is stolen, even their ships. They can't fly them very well, that's why they crash them, mostly into the sea. The American Nilitary hides them but are to stupit to fly them!
People of the future way this country will die because of a global Nuclear War.

That's too bad. Your leader and Military will be to blame. There's nothing that can be done I know you have tries to alert them of the danger but no one will listen. This country and another accross the sea will be the first two but others will follow as the Nuclear War spreads accross the globe.

     We wish you luck in your endevers in the future.I know things are difficult. I do hope this sector of the Comos doesn't explode as predicted in the future because of what happens here.

The war here must be an incredible one to do that. There are only a few Humans on other worlds not enough to resead another planet. If you can find a way to stop this insane President from starting this War, everyone would be greatly relieved. Things are bad enough. Like I say, I wish you well----goodbuy.
